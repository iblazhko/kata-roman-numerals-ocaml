## Problem description: Convert a number to Roman Numerals representation

Numbers in Roman Numerals system are represented by combinations
of letters from the Latin alphabet. Roman numerals, as used today,
are based on seven symbols:

- `I` : 1
- `V` : 5
- `X` : 10
- `L` : 50
- `C` : 100
- `D` : 500
- `M` : 1000

### Basic decimal pattern

The numbers from 1 to 10 are
expressed in Roman numerals as follows:

    I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X.

The numeral for 4 is represented with `IV` (one less than 5), instead of `IIII`;
and the numeral for 9 is represented with `IX` (one less than 10) instead
of `VIIII`. This feature of Roman numerals is called *subtractive notation*.

The system being basically decimal, tens and hundreds follow the same pattern:
10 to 100 are counted in tens, with `X` taking the place of `I`, `L` taking the place
of `V` and `C` taking the place of `X`:

    X, XX, XXX, XL, L, LX, LXX, LXXX, XC, C.

Note that 40 (`XL`) and 90 (`XC`) follow the same subtractive pattern as 4 and 9.

Similarly, 100 to 1000 (counting in hundreds):

    C, CC, CCC, CD, D, DC, DCC, DCCC, CM, M.

Again - 400 (`CD`) and 900 (`CM`) follow the standard subtractive pattern.

In the Roman numeral system being basically decimal, each "place" is added in
descending sequence from left to right, as with Arabic numerals. For example:

    39 = "Thirty nine" (XXX+IX) = XXXIX.
    246 = "Two hundred and forty six" (CC+XL+VI) = CCXLVI.

As each place has its own notation there is no need for place keeping zeros,
so "missing places" are ignored, as in Latin (and English) speech, thus:

    207 = "Two hundred and seven" (CC+VII) = CCVII
    1066 = "A thousand and sixty six" (M+LX+VI) = MLXVI.

Roman numerals for large numbers are nowadays seen mainly in the form of year
numbers, as in these examples:

    1776 (M+DCC+LXX+VI) = MDCCLXXVI
    1954 (M+CM+L+IV) = MCMLIV
    1990 (M+CM+XC) = MCMXC
    2014 (MM+X+IV) = MMXIV
    2023 (MM+XX+III) = MMXXIII
